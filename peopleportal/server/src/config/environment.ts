/**
 * Environment resolution, in the spirit of Django's settings modules.
 *
 * Files are layered lowest-priority first, so a value set in a more specific
 * file wins and nothing needs to be duplicated:
 *
 *     .env                     shared defaults, committed-adjacent
 *     .env.<environment>       per-environment overrides (.env.development, ...)
 *     .env.<environment>.local your machine only, gitignored
 *
 * Anything already present in the real process environment always wins over all
 * of them, so container and CI variables are never clobbered by a stray file.
