/**
 * Stale-while-revalidate envelope.
 *
 * A plain TTL makes exactly one unlucky request per expiry pay the full cold
 * cost, and under concurrency it is worse than one: every request arriving
 * during the rebuild misses too, and they all rebuild. Stamping the entry with
 * its build time lets a reader serve slightly stale data instantly and refresh
 * in the background, so the expensive path stops being on anyone's critical
 * path.
 *
 * Two bounds apply. The soft TTL is when a refresh is triggered; the hard TTL
 * is the Redis expiry, the absolute ceiling on staleness if every refresh
 * fails. Invalidation on write still deletes the key outright, so a real change
 * is never subject to either.
