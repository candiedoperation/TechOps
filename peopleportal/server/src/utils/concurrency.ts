/**
 * Runs an async mapper over a list with a ceiling on how many run at once.
 *
 * Sequential `for ... await` loops over network calls are the usual cause of an
 * endpoint that degrades linearly with the size of the club. Promise.all fixes
 * the latency but replaces it with an unbounded burst at whatever upstream is
 * being called. This sits in between.
 *
 * Results are returned in input order and settled, never thrown, so one failed
 * item cannot discard the successful ones: callers decide what a rejection
 * means, which for Authentik is the difference between "this group is gone,
 * clean it up" and "the directory is down, abort".
